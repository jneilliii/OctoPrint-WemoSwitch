Once installed go into settings and enter the name of your wemo device. Adjust additional settings as needed.

- **Enable startup event monitoring**: will power on enabled wemos when OctoPrint starts up after boot.
- **Enable upload event monitoring**: will power on enabled wemos when a file is uploaded with the start print on upload setting enabled (requires OctoPrint 1.4.1).
- **Enable thermal runaway monitoring**: will power off enabled wemos at set max temperatures.
- **Enable power off on idle**: will power off enabled wemos using following parameters.
  - Abort Power Off Timeout: a prompt will displayed in the UI to allow aborting idle power off for this period of time.
  - Idle Timeout: amount of time to wait before automatic power off of enabled wemos begins. Waits for timelapses to complete and for all temperatures to be below configured `Idle Target Temperature`.
  - Idle Target Temperature: temperature threshold to be below prior to starting idle timeout.
  - GCode Commands to Ignore for Idle: commands to be ignored for determining idle state.
- **Enable polling of status**: when enabled and while the UI is open the current state of all wemos will be checked at set interval.
- **Enable debug logging**: enables `plugin_wemoswitch_debug.log` file in OctoPrint's logging section for troubleshooting purposes.

- **IP Address**: IP address of the wemo device.
- **Icon Class**: class name from [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/3.2.1/cheatsheet/) to use for icon on button.
- **Label**: label to use for title attribute on hover over button in navbar.
- **Off on Idle**: power off wemo on idle timeout. Requires `Enable power off on idle` setting to be enabled.
- **On on Startup**: power on with OctoPrint startup. Requires `Enable startup event monitoring` setting to be enabled.
- **On on Upload**: power on when file is uploaded and flagged to auto start printing. Requires `Enable upload event monitoring` setting to be enabled and OctoPrint 1.4.1.
- **Warning Prompt**: confirmation prompt will always display when powering off a wemo from the navbar.
- **Warn While Printing**: confirmation prompt will display while printing when powering off a wemo from the navbar. Enabling this will also prevent gcode processing from powering off the wemo while printing unless a sufficient `GCODE Off Delay` is entered.
- **Thermal Runaway**: when enabled will power off wemo when main temperature thresholds are exceeded.
- **Auto Connect**: power on wemo and then automatically connect to printer after configured delay in seconds.
- **Auto Disconnect**: automatically disconnect printer and then power off the wemo after configured delay in seconds.
- **GCODE Trigger**: enable the processing of `M80`, `M81`, `@WEMOON`, and `@WEMOOFF` GCODE commands using configured delays. Syntax for gcode command is `M80`/`M81`/`@WEMOON`/`@WEMOOFF` followed by the wemo's ip address.  For example if your wemo's IP address is `192.168.0.104` your gcode command might be **@WEMOOFF 192.168.0.104**.
- **Run System Command After On**: power on wemo and run configured system command after configured delay in seconds.
- **Run System Command Before Off**: run configured system command and then power off the wemo after configured delay in seconds.
